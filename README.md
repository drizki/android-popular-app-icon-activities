## Why

So a while back, I wanted to create an Android icon pack. Upon researching, I noticed that most the tutorials out there are about getting started and doesn't guide you how to search for Android's popular apps (and its package name, activity, etc.).

Also, there are some paid services to do it but I don't think I want to spend money on it. So I did gather what I can find and place it here.

## Data

There are at least 7000 items on the database which are split (and also duplicated) into two main file. One is based on download count on Google Play Store and the other was gathered from digging Github repositories. I'll consider to merge them later.

The one from Google Play Store is limited to only include apps which has minimum of 1,000,000 installs.

## What can I use it for

You can use it for research, creating Android icon pack, or anything. I don't know.
