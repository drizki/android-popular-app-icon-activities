# Android Popular Apps

This repository contain most popular Android apps to this date.

## Why

So a while back, I wanted to create an Android icon pack. Upon researching, I noticed that most the tutorials out there are about getting started and doesn't guide you how to search for Android's popular apps (and its package name, activity, etc.) so I did gather what I can find and place it here.

## Data included

There are two data included. One is based on downloads count on the play store and the other was gathered from digging Github repositories.

## What can I use it for

You can use it for research, creating Android icon pack, or anything. I don't know.
