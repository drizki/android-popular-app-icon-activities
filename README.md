## Why

A while back ago, I wanted to create an Android icon pack. Upon researching, I noticed that most the tutorials out there are about getting started and doesn't guide you how to search for Android's popular apps (and its package name, activity, etc.) and I had no clue what icons should I design. There are some legit paid services to do it, but I don't think I want to spend money on it since it was only for fun.

So I slap my keyboard and gather what I can find on the internet and then I place it on my Google Spreadsheet. Later, I find it cool if I can share it to you so you don't have to do the hard work ðŸ’ª

## Data

There are at least 7000 items on the database which are split (and also duplicated) into two main file. One is based on download count on Google Play Store and the other was gathered from digging Github repositories. I'll consider to merge them later.

The one from Google Play Store is limited to only include apps which has minimum of 1,000,000 installs.

## What can I use it for

You can use it for research, creating Android icon pack, or anything. I don't know.
